# IDS-Anomaly-Detection-with-NSL-KDD
Anomaly detection in network traffic using the NSL-KDD dataset. The project preprocesses data, applies feature engineering, and trains a Random Forest model to classify network behavior as normal or anomalous. The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
